We model the display as springs on a net.  
Each node $Z_{i,j}(t)$ can move up or down, and four tiny coupling springs pull on its nearest neighbours.  
Together they obey the damped two-dimensional wave equation

\begin{equation*}
    \label{eq:wave}
    \frac{\partial^2 Z_{i,j}}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla Z_{i,j} - \gamma \frac{\partial Z_{i,j}}{\partial t}
\end{equation*}

By simply removing selected coupling springs we carve out boundaries,  
so any outline (heart, body pose, etc.) can sculpt the motion.  
In this piece a heart-shaped “muscle” sits at centre; it bends,  
reflects and gently absorbs passing ripples.

The springs are externally excited by any signal source, e.g. a microphone or plugged-in instrument.

This piece is designed to be interactive. For now, we present a recorded video of a live interaction,  
but we hope to install the fully interactive version during the exhibition month.
